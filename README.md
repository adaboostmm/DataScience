# Simple KNN algorithm in C++
Problem Derscription
Hubble Space Telescope has identified yet another new planet, NASA scientists has named it Luminary and  they want to find out the nearest neighbors of Luminary in Solar System. There are different types of planets in planetary system, scientists measured different features of 196 planetary objects and labeled them into six categories(Label 1,Label 2, Label 3, Label 5, Label 6, Label 7). Now we like to find out top K nearest neighbor of Luminary. 
We got a validation set with 13 datapoints with similar features. Let's code a basic KNN algorithm in C++ and measure the accuracy with the validation set.

The code uses Stanford C++ libraries.
This was done as a class project for CS106B: Programming Abstraction using C++ class.
